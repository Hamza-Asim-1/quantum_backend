# Profit Controller Implementation Summary

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Investment Plans** (matches UI)

Both files updated to match the UI investment plans:

**File: `b/src/services/profitCalculationService.ts`**
**File: `b/src/controllers/investmentController.ts`**

```typescript
const INVESTMENT_LEVELS = [
  { level: 1, name: 'Starter Plan', minAmount: 100, maxAmount: 1000, rate: 0.3 },
  { level: 2, name: 'Growth Plan', minAmount: 1001, maxAmount: 3000, rate: 0.4 },
  { level: 3, name: 'Professional Plan', minAmount: 3001, maxAmount: 6000, rate: 0.5 },
  { level: 4, name: 'Premium Plan', minAmount: 6001, maxAmount: 10000, rate: 0.6 },
  { level: 5, name: 'Elite Plan', minAmount: 10001, maxAmount: 999999999, rate: 0.7 },
];
```

**Changes:**
- Renamed plans to match UI: "Starter Plan", "Growth Plan", "Professional Plan", "Premium Plan", "Elite Plan"
- Updated profit rates from percentages (2.5%, 3.0%, etc.) to decimals (0.3%, 0.4%, etc.) to match UI
- Updated amounts to match UI ranges (100-1000, 1001-3000, etc.)

### 2. **Created Profit Controller**

**File: `b/src/controllers/profitController.ts`**

Controller with 6 endpoints:

#### **User Endpoints:**
1. `getUserProfitSummary` - Get user's total profit overview
2. `getUserProfitHistory` - Get user's profit transaction history

#### **Admin Endpoints:**
3. `getAllUsersProfitStats` - Get profit statistics for all users
4. `getProfitRunHistory` - Get history of profit distribution runs
5. `getProfitStatistics` - Get overall platform profit statistics
6. `getUserProfitDetails` - Get detailed profit info for specific user

### 3. **Created Profit Routes**

**File: `b/src/routes/profitRoutes.ts`**

User routes:
- `GET /api/v1/profits/summary` - User's profit summary
- `GET /api/v1/profits/history` - User's profit history

### 4. **Updated Admin Routes**

**File: `b/src/routes/adminRoutes.ts`**

Added admin profit endpoints:
- `GET /api/v1/admin/profits/stats` - Overall profit statistics
- `GET /api/v1/admin/profits/runs` - Profit run history
- `GET /api/v1/admin/profits/users` - All users' profit stats
- `GET /api/v1/admin/profits/users/:userId` - Specific user's profit details

### 5. **Registered Routes in App**

**File: `b/src/app.ts`**

Added profit routes to main application.

## 🔄 How Profit Calculation Works

Based on the updated investment levels:

1. **User invests $2,000** → Level 2 (Growth Plan) at **0.4% daily**
2. **Daily profit** = $2,000 × 0.4% = **$8.00 per day**
3. **After 30 days** = $2,000 × 0.4% × 30 = **$240.00 total profit**

**Important:** These are fixed daily amounts (not compounding).
